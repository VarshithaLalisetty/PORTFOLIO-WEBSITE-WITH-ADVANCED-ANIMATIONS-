*DESCRIPTION*
For this project, I set out to create a personal portfolio website that not only showcases my work as a web developer but also reflects my personality and creativity through smooth animations and modern design. The goal was to build an interactive and visually engaging website using simple web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while enhancing the user experience with animation libraries like GSAP and optionally Three.js.

The site is designed to be a digital resume and portfolio — a place where potential employers or clients can quickly get a sense of who I am, what I do, and what I’ve built. It includes key sections like a home page with animated text, an about me section, a project gallery, and a contact form. Each part of the site is crafted to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.

To make the site feel lively and polished, I used GSAP for animations. This allowed me to create effects like smooth transitions between sections, elements that fade or slide in as you scroll, animated buttons, and interactive project cards. These animations aren’t just for show — they’re designed to guide the viewer’s attention and make the experience more enjoyable. I also explored Three.js to experiment with subtle 3D visuals that can make the site stand out, but kept it simple to stay focused on performance and user experience.

The core of the website is built with HTML for structure and CSS for styling and layout. I used Flexbox and Grid to organize content in a way that looks good across different screen sizes. JavaScript handles interactivity — things like navigation toggles, form handling, and triggering animations at the right time. For the contact form, I connected a basic backend using Flask (Python), which collects and stores the messages users send through the form. This way, the site isn't just a static page — it has functionality that makes it feel more complete.

Creating this portfolio was also about learning how to combine design and development in a way that communicates who I am as a developer. I paid attention to small details, like hover effects, icon animations, and consistent styling, to ensure a cohesive look. Accessibility and usability were also important to me, so I made sure the site works well with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and gave me hands-on experience with animation libraries and backend integration. More than just a coding task, it’s a creative project I’m proud of — one that shows what I can do and what I’m passionate about in web development.
